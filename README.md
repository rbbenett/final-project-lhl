# Typecraft

Typecraft is a game to help you practice you're typing speed. Once you register for an account, You'll be directed to the game where you'll be given 30 seconds to type in all the words on your screen. As the levels go up, you'll be given more and more words to, making it harder and harder to finish the level. You can check the leaderboard and see how you match up with other users and see you're own best scores and you're overall typing speeds on your profile page. This project was bootstrapped with Create React App.

## Getting started

1. Inside of the final-project & final-project-api run npm install

2. Once everything is finished installing, setup a .env file with PORT = 'Whichever port you want to run the app on", REACT_APP_GOOGLE_API_KEY = "You're own Google Maps api key"

3. Run npm start on both the final-project & final-project-api to launch the app.

4. Enjoy the game and start practicing that typing.
